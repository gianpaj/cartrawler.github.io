<h5>Retrieval of objects from Inpath Process</h5>


If a user selected a car during the in path process, the onActivityForResult will be fired. Objects can be retrieved at this point, namely the payload, the fees object and the vehicle details object

These objects are accessed via the return intent by onActivityForResult

```kotlin   
    getStringExtra(CartrawlerSDK.PAYLOAD) // Returns a JSON String
    
    getParcelableExtra(CartrawlerSDK.VEHICLE_DETAILS) // Returns a VehicleDetails Object
    
    getSerializableExtra(CartrawlerSDK.FEES) // Returns a Payment Object
    
    getParcelableExtra(CartrawlerSDK.TRIP_DETAILS) // Returns a Trip Object with extras included
        
        
    override fun onActivityForResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
       if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
           if (requestCode == 123) {
                openCreditCardProcessor(data!!.getStringExtra(CartrawlerSDK.PAYLOAD))
            }      
    }
```    
    
The json payload object is returned so that the partner can process the payment/reservation with a cartrawler payment end point at a different time and point in the partners basket flow. This JSON playload object is passed to this endpoint. 
Further details can be found in our OTA developer docs. (Also see inpath reservation section)

The CartrawlerSDK.FEES object:
```kotlin
    cartrawler.core.data.external.Payment {
          
          public String currency; // The currency of the fees

          public Double payNowAmount; // The pay now amount
          public Double payAtDeskAmount; // The pay at desk amount
          public Double bookingFeeAmount; // The booking fee amount
      
          public String insuranceName; // The insurance name
          public Double insuranceAmount; //The insurance amount
          
          public String authTotal; //The total amount to be authorized against the customers credit card.
          pubic  String authCurrency; // The currency code of the authTotal
     }
```
    
The CartrawlerSDK.TRIP_DETAILS object:
```kotlin
    @Parcelize
    data class TripDetails(
            var pickUpDateTime: String? = null,
            var returnDateTime: String? = null,
            var pickupLocation: @RawValue LocationDetails? = null,
            var returnLocation: @RawValue LocationDetails? = null,
            var vehicleCharges: List<VehicleCharge> // The list of Vehicle Charges (0 or more)
            var extras: List<Extra>) : Parcelable // The list of extras (0 or more)
            
            
    @Parcelize
    data class Extra (
            var amount: Double? = null,
            var currencyCode: String? = null,
            var name: String? = null,
            var description: String? = null,
            var type: String? = null, // the CT Code we use
            var selected: Int? = null, // the number of selected extras or qty
            var includedInRate: Boolean? = null // Is this an extra selected by the user or already part of rate
    ): Parcelable
    
    @Parcelize
    class VehicleCharge (
        var chargeDescription: String? = null, // The localized description
        var taxInclusive: String? = null, // Is tax included?
        var includedInRate: String? = null, // In this inpath payload use case this is always 'true'
        var purpose: String? = null, // Internal Purpose code
        var calculation: String? = null, // Reserved as "BeforePickup"
        var amount: Double? = null, // The amount of charge
        var currencyCode: String? = null // The currencyCode of the charge
    )  : Parcelable
```
          
     
The total amount to be authorized against the customers credit card, is the authTotal attribute above. This is calcuated by cartrawler using paynow, insurance, and bookingfee amounts when applicable.
 
**Notes on other attributes:**

*Insurance*
* If insurance is selected, insuranceAmount will be non-zero.
* The insuranceName will non-null when insuranceAmount is non-zero.
* The insuranceName is the title of the insurance.

*Extras*
* If the user has selected extras, the total amount of extra fees will set in payAtDeskAmount. <br>

*Totals*
* payNowAmount is the total amount for only the car element (excludes extras,  bookingfee and insurance)
* bookingFeeAmount is a cartrawler fee which is separate to the payNowAmount.
* The authTotal is calculated by the cartrawler system by adding the payNowAmount, bookingFeeAmount (if present) and insuranceFee (if present).
